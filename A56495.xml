            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> having failed in his Design upon <hi>Woerden,</hi> and despairing of being able to Act any thing with Success against the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> resolved to pass into the Countrey of <hi>Liege</hi> with his Horse, which he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to strengthen with a Body of Foot to be drawn in his passage out of the Cities of <hi>Breda, Boisleduc, Bergen-op-Zoom,</hi> and <hi>Maestricht.</hi> With this Army he promised himself nothing less, then to force the <hi>French</hi> from those Posts they held in the Countrey of <hi>Liege.</hi> But the Count <hi>de Monterey,</hi> Governour of the <hi>Low-countreys</hi> for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> not thinking it fit to quit the advantages he intended to procure to the King his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, in putting his Garrisons into those places, under colour of defending them, would not suffer that they should be drawn out, and offered to give the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> as he has done, 3000 Horse, and a like number of Foot, under the command of the Count <hi>de Marcin.</hi> Thereupon he put himself in a condition to attaque and take the Castle of <hi>Fauquemont,</hi> in the Countrey of <hi>Holland,</hi> where there was a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94049:3"/>
               <hi>French</hi> Garrison of 130 men. Immediately after this he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested <hi>Tongres,</hi> with design in appearance of attacking it But the Count <hi>de Marcin</hi> having represented unto him, that the place, though without any considerable Fortifications, might defend it self for some time, and ruine his Army, he sends, by the Prince's advice, to the Count <hi>Monterey,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to him the Besieging of <hi>Charleroy;</hi> using, as a main ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to induce him to consent to it, the absence of the Count <hi>de Montal,</hi> who was then at <hi>Tongres;</hi> for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and divers others, he conceived the place was left with a very weak Garrison. The Count <hi>de Monterey</hi> embraced the Enterprise, and more to secure the good success of it, sent him the greatest part of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Forces he could get to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in his Government, disfurnishing upon that account, of their Garrisons, the most important places of the King h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s Master, without making any reflexions but upon the assured conquest of <hi>Charleroy,</hi> or considering the Faith of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the <hi>Pyreneans,</hi> and <hi>Aix la Chapelle.</hi> The 15. instant, the Count <hi>de Marcin</hi> invested <hi>Charleroy</hi> with the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry which was quartered in <hi>Flanders,</hi> expecting the arrival of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> with his Army, which was two days after on the 17. In the mean time the <hi>Spaniards</hi> thinking that <hi>Binch,</hi> a Fort lying between this place and <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h,</hi> would be useful to them, as well to favour their Retreat, if need were, as to facilitate the passage of their Convoys, sent out a party of their Troops to invest it, who made themselves masters of it with a great deal of ease, being no place of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. They put a <hi>Spanish</hi> Garrison into it, in the name of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and took care to send a <hi>Spanish</hi> Colonel to seize upon the Keepers of the Castle of <hi>Marimont,</hi> a House of Pleasure, yielded to the King by the Treaty of <hi>Aix la Chapelle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Count <hi>de Montal</hi> had advice of all their motions, and was assured of them by the Sieur <hi>de St. Cla,</hi> a Brigadeer of Horse, who came from <hi>Maseick</hi> in the company of the Sieurs <hi>St Sylvestre,</hi> and <hi>Darcy,</hi> Captains of Light Horse, <hi>de Labadie, Vignart,</hi> and <hi>de Treuil,</hi> Lieutenants; <hi>Levignay</hi> and <hi>Magny,</hi> Cornets; <hi>Lapair</hi> and <hi>Lempereur,</hi> Quarter-masters, with Fifty Horse, with intent to cast themselves with him into his Government.</p>
            <p>The Count <hi>de Montal</hi> accompanied with this Troop, and 60 Horse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ore, which he brought with him to <hi>Tongres,</hi> went out of the Town the 17 instant, at 10 of the clock in the morning, resolving to get into <hi>Charleroy</hi> the next day by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94049:3"/> break of day, and to force the Quarter through which he was to pass, if there was no other way.</p>
            <p>He went along the great Causey, the same way the Enemies had gone before, imagining that they would least suspect that way of any other: He had not gone above five or six Leagues, but he met with some of their Scouts, which he caused to be dismounted, and stript, that so the cold which was then extreme, might force them to retire into the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages to warm themselves, and hinder them from returning to the Army to advise them of their approach.</p>
            <p>That night he got very near to <hi>Perruis,</hi> where the <hi>Dutch</hi> Foot were lodg'd, and the Horse that accompanied them, in the Villages all along the Causey, as far as <hi>Gimblour:</hi> and meeting with other Troops further on this side <hi>Charleroy,</hi> he was forced to turn to the Right, and to fetch a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass about to avoid them, marching towards <hi>Mellet,</hi> to get into the Wood.</p>
            <p>When day-light began to appear, he advanced but slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, expecting the breaking up of the Main-guard; which happened according to his desire: so that at his coming out of the Wood, he found a Regiment of <hi>Spanish</hi> Foot lodg'd in the Front, and was got in amongst them so on a suddain, that they scarce perceived him.</p>
            <p>Although they suspected him to be an Enemy, they durst not make an Alarm, because it was out of their power now to take him: and in exchange of their forced discretion, he returned them the civility of some words in their own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: to which they all answered with a very handsome salute, taking no notice that he was of any other Party then their own.</p>
            <p>But when he came near the Glass-house, where others of the Enemy were lodg'd, as in all the Houses thereabouts, some discovered, that all of his Troop had their Swords naked under their Cloaks, excepting onely fifteen, and two Officers, who marched before the Count <hi>de Montal</hi> and the Sieur <hi>de St. Cla,</hi> with their Carbines advanced, that they might more easily break through what ever should oppose them.</p>
            <p>These cried, <hi>To your Arms,</hi> and discharged at them as they passed before and behind, so that the Alarm was presently all over the Camp. But their Horse-Guard of 150 Maistres, posted between their Camp and the Town, having just be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unbridled their Horses, not being able to mount so soon as was requisite, there were not above 80 who could come
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94049:4"/> to oppose them, with a Major named <hi>Floris</hi> in the Head of them, a person much esteem'd amongst them.</p>
            <p>The Count <hi>de Montal</hi> received them so vigorously, that that Officer and part of his men were killed, without any loss of our side but of 14 men onely kill'd and taken priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, because it was not thought worth the while to stay to rescue them at that time. Thus he got into <hi>Charleroy,</hi> not less successfully then gloriously, on <hi>Brussels</hi> side, with 100 Horse in his company, and the Officers, who had done on this occasion all that could be expected of persons effectively gallant.</p>
            <p>He found the place straitned enough, by the Posts the Enemies possessed, most of them within Musket-shot, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having taken any of the Out-works: the <hi>Sieur de Franc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu,</hi> the Kings Lieutenant, who commanded in the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours absence, having done all that was requisite to hinder them from executing any such design.</p>
            <p>He found in like manner the Garrison very well disposed to acquit themselves of their Duty. The Sieur <hi>Desbonnais</hi> Brigadeer of Foot, that was by good chance left there, had particularly laboured to prepare those of the Garrison, for the service this Occasion required of them: And the Sieur <hi>Terrade</hi> Engineer, whose business it was to look after the Works, had not omitted any thing for the putting them in as good posture of Defence, as the few Men in Garrison would permit.</p>
            <p>The principal Care now being, to make provision of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, for the Horse that were newly come into the Place; the Count <hi>de Montal,</hi> some few hours after his arrival, sent out 150 Musketeers, under the Command of the said Sieur <hi>Desbonnais,</hi> to fetch in what was to be found, along the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Sambre,</hi> at houses a good distance from the Town.</p>
            <p>They acquitted themselves so well of this Charge, with the help of 50 Horse very much tired, that in three hours time they had gathered up all the Forage, forced the Enemies from a Post, guarded by a party of Horse and Foot, and killed them several Men, with the loss only of two Soldiers on their part.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Count <hi>de Montal,</hi> judging by a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery they had raised upon an Eminence, on the other side of two little Moats, where the Works are but single, and were in a manner deserted, that they intended to make their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Attack there; he resolved to place a guard there, and to make all the Resistance that was possible.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:94049:4"/>
            <p>Besides, the Traverses that the said Sieur <hi>de Terrade,</hi> by the Order of the Sieur <hi>Franclieu,</hi> had begun to draw from one <hi>Epaule</hi> to the other, were pressed extreamly: And though they were not finished, the Governor placed some men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, as the number he had would give him leave, with Captains and Officers, resolved to stand by them, and some Horse in the Ditch, where there were no Traverses of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lissadoes, that they might have more liberty to act.</p>
            <p>The Sieurs of <hi>Franclieu</hi> and <hi>des Bonnais,</hi> were likewise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stined to defend severally the Posts that might be attacked. But the enemy did not think fit to attack them that night, and the Count <hi>de Montal</hi> perceived the next morning, that they had discontinued their Battery, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to him by the said Sieur <hi>de Franclieu,</hi> who likewise took care to observe their countenance on that side.</p>
            <p>Thereupon he resolved the next day, Nineteenth, to make a sally with all his Horse, upon the Eminence of <hi>Brussels,</hi> and to line the Counterscarpes, and outworks with all his Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kettiers; amongst whom was the Sieur <hi>de Desbonnais,</hi> on purpose to take prisoners, which had all the good success that could be desired.</p>
            <p>FIrst sallied out Twenty Horse, commanded by the Sieurs <hi>Labadie</hi> and <hi>Janvrye,</hi> and fell upon the enemies lesser guard, which lay sheltered upon the descent of the Hill, on the other side of the Church-yard; and whilst the rest of the French Troops were likewise coming up to them, the enemies great Guard, being One hundred and fifty Horse, advanced under the command of the Baron <hi>de St. Jean.</hi> The French received them with much bravery, and having given them a considerable shock, killed and wounded many of them on the place; and taking a Lieutenant, with several others prisoners, retired towards the Counterscharpe, to draw the enemy under our Guns. The Baron <hi>de St. Jean</hi> having received two mortal wounds in his Brest.</p>
            <p>The Enemy followed very warily, yet not so, but that fifty Muskettiers which the Count <hi>de Montal</hi> had Posted in one of the Half Moons, had apportunity to make a discharge upon them, in which they killed several of them; and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occasioned such disorder amongst them, that the Prince <hi>de Vaudemont,</hi> the Sieur <hi>de Louvignie,</hi> and several other persons of quality were fain to come to their assistance.</p>
            <p>But the French at the same time caused their Cannon to play so well upon the enemy, that they killed several of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94049:5"/> them; and amongst others, three Cornets of Horse, one of them being of the Prince's own Troop; the Prince <hi>de Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demont</hi> had his Horse killed under him, and received some slight wounds; the Sieur <hi>de Louvignie</hi> had likewise his Horse killed, and his Heel shot off with a Cannon Bullet; so that he is in danger of losing his Leg, or his life.</p>
            <p>The Besieged were out about an hour and a half in this Sally, and Masters of the Enemies Ground; and put the Enemy into such a fear, that they durst never after advance in the several Sallies, which the French continued to make out of the place. In the mean time, the Count <hi>de Montal</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every night informed, that the Enemy were opening their Trenches; and besides, that they had great numbers of Faggots, Bales of Wool, and Barrels, at least 2000, and other Provisions, to be employed in this Siege, resolved with the few men he had to defend the Counterscharps; but was prevented; for the One and twentieth in the morning, the Count <hi>de Marcin,</hi> ordered the Twenty pieces of Cannon with two Mortar pieces, sent to the Army by the Count <hi>de Monterey,</hi> some days before, and the said Bales of Wool, Faggots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be sent back to <hi>Namur.</hi> And the 22 at break of day, all the Enemies Troops broke up and retired; those that lay on the other side of the <hi>Sambre,</hi> passed that River at <hi>Marchiennes au Pont,</hi> and took their way by <hi>Fontaine l' Evesque</hi> and <hi>Binche,</hi> and the rest marched on the side of the Plain of <hi>Mellet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Troops that invested the place, and against whom the Besieged were to defend themselves, were all Spanish, the Dutch having been Posted on the other side of the Water.</p>
            <p>In this occasion we cannot sufficiently admire the courage and conduct of the Sieur <hi>de Montal,</hi> in putting himself into the place, and defending it so bravely afterward. Much praise is likewise due to the Sieur <hi>de St. Cla,</hi> and the rest of the Officers that accompanied him, and all the Soldiery that were concerned in the Action.</p>
            <p>For the rest, all things were so well ordered for the defence of the place, that the Officers of that Garrison could not without regret see the Enemy decamp, having promised themselves farther occasion of signalising their zeal and courage.</p>
